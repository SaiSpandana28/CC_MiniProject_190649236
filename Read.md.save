The Project is part of the course work for Cloud Computing

It is an application to track the statistics of countries affected by Coronavirus

Steps to be implemented :

Create a t2.medium instance in AWS and connect to it through the terminal using the .pem key file by following the commands ssh -i key_name.pem ubuntu@public_dns of instance.

TO CONNECT TO AN EXTERNAL API

Once the instance is up and running create a file app.py . The programm is written in a way that it would connect to an external api and retrieve the results and display as a webpage.
The name of the api that this application connects to is Coronavirus COVID19 API 'https://api.covid19api.com/'
The file app.py has the following set of features:

1)It would give the statistics till date of the countries affected including TotalConfirmed , Deaths and the url to execute in the browser is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/summary
2)It would give the increemental details of the cases in a country from the day the first case was recorded Url to be executed is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/dayone/country/<countryname>
3)It would give a list of countries affected by Coronavirus. URL is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/countries
4)It would give the stats of he cases worldwide URL is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/sum

TO STORE PERSISTENT INFORMATION AND ACCESS FROM CLOUD DATABASE 

The file COVID_Data_Basic.csv is taken and copied into EC2 instance. A docker container is created and the latest version of ccassandra is pulled into it. The file is then copied to the Container.
A connection is made to the cqlsh and the neccesary keyspace(covid19) and tables are created and the contents of the .csv file are copied to the table (covid19.stats). On this table the GET,POST,DELETE are implemented
1) GET request pulls info about number of cases as on a date : URL is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/country/<country>
2) DELETE Removes an entry from the table for a particular id  URL is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/delete/<id>
3) UPDATES the confirmed cases and date for a particular id URL is http://ec2-3-89-33-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com/update/<id>/<confirmednumber>/<date>
